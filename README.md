# About me
## My Hobbies
  * Gym
  * Hockey
  * Painting
  * Traveling to new countries
## Websites I find Interesting
  * [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) - I find YouTube interesting because it has anything you want to see. Do I need to change the alternator in my car? Youtube. Do I want to see cats flying in space? YouTube.
  * [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/travel/flights?gl=US&hl=en-US) - Most people do not know this but Google Flights is the best way to find flights when flying internationally. You can even do one better and use a VPN to switch from a US server to another country, and you will sometimes find cheaper flights.
