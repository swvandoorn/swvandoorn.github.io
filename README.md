# **_About me_**
## **Hobbies**
  * Gym
    - I go to the gym about seven days a week. I just skip cardio so I can't lose weight.
  * Hockey
    - I used to play hockey at the college level back in 2014. Now I just substitute on my friend's adult league team.
  * Painting
  * Traveling to new countries
    - Recently I visited the Philippines and Vietnam. The next trip I am planning is to Belgium, maybe Germany, and Switzerland.
## **Websites I find Interesting**
  * [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com)  
    - I find YouTube interesting because it has anything you want to see. Do I need to change the alternator in my car? Youtube. Do I want to see cats flying in space? YouTube.
  * [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/travel/flights?gl=US&hl=en-US)  
    - Most people do not know this but Google Flights is the best way to find flights when flying internationally. You can even do one better and use a VPN to switch from a US server to another country, and you will sometimes find cheaper flights.
